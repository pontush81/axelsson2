 Story:  
 As an Administrator, I want to clarification to the configuration UI, because we are using same view for Scheduled and Event-based provisioning and there are mandatory fields which are not needed on event-based provisioning. I would like to also have information of the task status in order to get help on installation phase and for problem solving.  
 
 Provisioning task "Add a new task" would be remaining as it is 
 When admin wants to create new provisioning task, they have same view, where they can choose AD or Azure AD 
 When source is chosen admins would see section to choose provisioning type 
   
    Scheduled based provisioning 
   Event-based provisioning 
    Authentication 
    
  Then it shows the mappings type 
   
   Single (either Identity or Access Rights) 
    
 Existing provisioning task is possible to copy when creating new task 
 Provisioning task provide visibility 
   
   of the task status on the left-hand side column (Last execution was successful, etc) 
   to see extract and load status from each task 
   to see history of previous scheduled runs 
    
 Provisioning task contain buttons to test connection and authentication

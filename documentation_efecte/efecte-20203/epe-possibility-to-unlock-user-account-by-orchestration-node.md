   As a service management tool user I want to have an orchestration node to unlock a user account in order to both manually as well automatically unlock an account in the AD which has been locked by failed password attempts.  
  
 ACs:  
 
 the administrator must be able to add  an activity "Unlock user account" for the "Efecte Provisioning Engine" in the orchestration node of the visual workflow automation 
 the service management tool must be able to instruct the AD to unlock an account 
 
 Note:  
 
 the functionality can be triggered from the Workspace UI in the service management tool by a support person with the click of a button in the person data card 
 the functionality can be triggered from the self-service portal

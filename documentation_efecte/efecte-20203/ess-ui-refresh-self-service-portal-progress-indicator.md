   User Story:  
 As a user, I want to see progress in service bundles to the next step as String of Perls as modern execution of workflows.  
  
 ACs:  
 
 if there is an ongoing bundle order, the phase of the order shall be visualized with a progress cycle on mobile devices 
 if there is an ongoing bundle order, the phase of the order shall be on the left-hand side of the order procedure and shown as a string of pearls (including text) on desktop devices

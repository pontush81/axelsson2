  ContentsUser story:Background information:What?How?Why?To whom?User story: 
 As an admin of Efecte's Provisioning Engine tool (EPE), I want to easily configure new EPE tasks. As an admin I want to EPE show only the folders that are allowed for the target template. It is currently possible to select a folder that does not allow a target template.  
Background information: 
What? 
 
 This is part of the EPE usage improvements story 
 
How? 
 
   EPE will narrow down list of Folders to choose from based on the template  
   
     Target folder is filtered by target template in EPE Schedule-based provisionings   
     Target folder is filtered by target template in EPE Event-based provisioning   
    
   Export of EPE task will preserve the right folder   
 
Why? 
 
 This helps configuring EPE tasks, less errors 
 Moving EPE task from test environment to production is flawless when folder is preserved 
 
To whom? 
 
 EPE Administrators

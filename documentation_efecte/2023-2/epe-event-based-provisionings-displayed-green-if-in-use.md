  ContentsUser story:Background information:What?How?Why?To whom?  
User story: 
 As an admin of Efecte's Provisioning Engine tool (EPE), I want to easily see which event-based provisionings are in use and which are not.  
Background information: 
What? 
 
 This is part of the EPE usage improvements story 
 
How? 
 
 EPE UI is updated to show event-based statuses based on the colors 
   
   Green = Task is attached to published workflow 
   Yellow = Task is attached to unpublished workflow 
   White/Default = Task is not attached to any workflow 
    
 
Why? 
 
 This helps in maintaining EPE tasks 
 The dependency of EPE event-based tasks and workflows becomes visible 
 
To whom? 
 
 Efecte provisioning engine admins

Problem statement
Text block elements placed on the forms do not support URL links that direct end users to external pages where they can see more details of the issue they are reporting.
 
Short description
Administrators shall be able to decorate text block elements with rich text elements and configure clickable URL links for the text block elements.
 
Use case details
As an admin, I want to offer URL links and more structured guidance to end users with Text blocks.  
AC:

 Admins shall be able to decorate text block elements on Forms with rich text 
  
   Most importantly, links with anchor texts should be supported
   Images shall not be allowed in these text blocks
   The rich text editor toolbar would be consistent with the ESM rich text editor
  
 The character limit for text blocks shall be 10 000 instead of 2000.

Problem statement 
In the early access beta UI (ESM 2023.3), the datacard view currently offers a restricted range of supported functionalities. Unfortunately, one functionality currently missing is the ability to transform datacards. 
Short description
We are introducing an enhancement to address these issues. We plan to introduce support for transforming datacards within the newly implemented datacard view in the early access beta UI. 
Use case details
The functionality of the Transform capabilities in the new datacard view will closely align with that of the current UI. The visual appearance of the transform buttons is renewed.

  Problem statement 
Columns in connector view are sometimes too narrow to show the full length of the column values or are consuming too much space.
 
Short description
We are introducing an enhancement to address this issue. Connector page renewal includes an enhancement that the connector columns can be resized.
 
Use case details
User can adjust columns easily from the Connector UI. Previously this was not possible to do. This feature makes it easier to manage connectors.

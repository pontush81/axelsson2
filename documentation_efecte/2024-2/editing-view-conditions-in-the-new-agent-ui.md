Problem statement 
The new UI supports list views, but not view conditions for filtering the data shown in the list views. Searching for information in is difficult without being able to filter data based on attribute values, and it is cumbersome to only use views created in the old UI for finding lists of information.
 
Short description

Use case details
The agent is able to filter out information based on different conditions and save new views. It should be possible to view existing views. All data types are supported.

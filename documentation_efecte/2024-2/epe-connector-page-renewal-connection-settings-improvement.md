  Problem statement 
Each connector task requires the connection settings to be configured separately, even if the source directory is the same. This causes a lot of maintenance if, for example, the target system password is changed. Especially in IGA solutions there are several connector tasks to the same directory.
 
Short description
We are introducing an enhancement to address this issue. Connector page renewal includes an enhancement that the connection settings needs to be defined only once per connector.
 
Use case details
Connector page renewal includes improvement that the connection settings needs to be defined only once per connector (directory). Previously, these had to be defined for each task separately.

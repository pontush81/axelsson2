Problem statement
The approver needs more information on pending orders requested by end-users, in order to make a proper approval decision.
 
Short description
The ESM administrator can configure and show on the approval table an additional information attribute that includes essential information from the order to help the approver make a proper decision.  
 
Use case details
As an approver, I want to see more details of what the end user is ordering before I make a decision.
 
AC:

 In General settings, under the Approval settings - there will be a configurable option called "Approval details”
 Attribute type for the configurable field shall be the text type of attribute
 Code for the attribute is expected to be in the Order template, which is defined in the "Order template" 
 On the Approval table on ESS2 UI, introduce new column for Additional information
 Setting is optional

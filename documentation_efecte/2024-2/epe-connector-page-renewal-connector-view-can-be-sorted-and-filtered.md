Problem statement 
If there are several connectors in the environment it is difficult to find them as they cannot be sorted or filtered in any way. 
 
Short description
We are introducing an enhancement to address this issue. Connector page renewal includes an enhancement that the connector views can be sorted and filtered.
 
Use case details
User can filter results easily from the Connector UI and sort the results. Previously this was not possible for the connectors. This feature makes it easier to manage connectors.

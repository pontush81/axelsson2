Problem statement
End users cannot see their closed cases on the self-service user interface.
 
Short description
End users need more filtered views of their cases. In addition to being able to see open cases, they should also be able to view cases that have already been solved.
 
Use case details
As an end-user, I want to review closed or resolved cases,
so that I can view information that might be relevant to my new request.
 
AC:

 In the self-service portal, end-users will be able to see an overview of Closed Requests
 Closed requests can be accessed via My Cases
 Table columns are Name, Created, Resolved Date, and Resolution
 Selecting a closed request takes the user to the case presentation for the request 
 On the closed cases list 
  
   User can filter the table by name or resolution
   The table can be re-sorted by name and created by date
  
 On the Closed cases table/list, 
  
   User can select to load closed cases based on the time the case was Created or Resolved
   Users can select the time period

Problem statement
Administrators spend a lot of time maintaining existing self-service item forms, especially if they want to introduce a new additional information field and make it one of the first questions.
 
Short description
When adding new additional information fields, the admin should have better tools to quickly move the item to the top of the fields.
 
Use case details
As an admin, I want to quickly move new additional information fields to the top of the form when there are multiple fields.
 
AC:

  the admin has a quick action button to move additional information directly to the top or bottom
 the admin can expand or collapse all additional information fields so that they can see an overview of the fields easier

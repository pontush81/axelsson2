This video will show you how easy it is to change the data card template layout. Just by dragging and dropping classes into one, two or three columns you can make the most of the layout.
By using containers, you can even have a mix of different numbers of columns. And now you can also change one column to be wider than the other. Check the video to learn how.
 Thanks for watching, and as always, don't hesitate to contact us in case you have any questions!

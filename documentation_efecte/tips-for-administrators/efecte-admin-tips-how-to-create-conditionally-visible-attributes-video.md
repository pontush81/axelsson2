 With conditional attributes you can create dynamic template content.   
 When template has an attribute with static values can other attributes be set to become visible based on the value in this attribute.    
 The use case in this video is Major Incident related conditional attributes in Incident template.  Those attributes will become visible based on the decision of the end-user on the Major incident attribute (Yes or No).   
 Watch this video and learn how to do it.

Global Search in Efecte Self-Service Portal (ESS) is a quick way to find services, own requests from the My requests view, knowledge base articles and more. All you need to do is to enable the search from admin settings. Go to the ESS admin UI and select Global search enabled.   Global search finds
·        available services by their name and their service item name ·        available incident reporting domain names and their categories ·        previous own incident reports by their subject and ID ·        previous own requests for service by their name and ID ·        Tips and Tricks by their keywords
Please notice that Global search doesn't find any requests made by others in the Our requests view, only user's own.

This video will show you how you can add or edit help texts within our Service Management Tool.
You can help users to fill the template fields with help texts. Help texts are useful when entering values into the fields, but they also help viewers to understand what entered values mean. With well thought and up-to-date help texts your Efecte users are always informed what is the right way to manage the data cards.

This video contains information on how to define MyServices to be used with service offers and incident reporting forms. MyServices can be used in My things as well.  
What are MyServices?   Efecte Self-Service Portal supports displaying user or service specific information saved in Service Management. So, we can use the data which already exists in Service Management as dropdown values and MyThings lists. This information might entail for example which assets have been registered for a particular user, list of cost centers, locations and so on. The information is used as part of service request as well as in incident reports to make service flow smoother.
Watch this video and learn how to define and utilize MyServices.

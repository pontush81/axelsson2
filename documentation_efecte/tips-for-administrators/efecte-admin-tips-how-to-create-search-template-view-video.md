Search templates are very useful if you have a massive amount of data cards and you know what you are looking for. There is less activity to the server and therefore it makes finding data cards faster when you don’t have to wait for the initial list to appear.
This functionality is not only for the administrators. Normal level users can also create search template view. Normal level user can save the view only under personal view unless otherwise permitted. 
Check this video and learn how to create search template view.

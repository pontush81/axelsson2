 User session - floating licenses  
 ESM version 2020.4 is more aggressive on refreshing (loading) parts of the UI than previous versions. This can cause sessions not expiring automatically after idle time especially with users using floating licences. The upcoming 2021.1 release will remove this more aggressive refresh part and the sessions of floating license users will be terminated more easily.  
 Logging out manually from the user profile is still the preferred way to end the user session.

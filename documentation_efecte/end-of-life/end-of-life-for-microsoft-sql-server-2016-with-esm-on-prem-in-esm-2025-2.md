Microsoft SQL Server 2016 will no more be supported in ESM on-prem installations, starting in 2025.2. The last planned version with MS SQL Server 2016 support is 2025.1. Microsoft SQL Server 2016 is reaching it's end of extended support in 2026, and we want to focus our efforts on modernizing our platform.
If you have been using Microsoft SQL For on-prem installations, you will need to upgrade to Microsoft SQL Server 2019, or start discussing with your Matrix42 (Efecte) Representative about migrating your environment to the cloud.
This announcement does not impact Efecte Cloud customers.

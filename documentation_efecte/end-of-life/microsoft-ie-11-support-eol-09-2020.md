 Due to performance issues with Microsoft Internet Explorer version 11, we are announcing the end of life for IE 11 support with our 2020.3 release of the Efecte Service Management Tool.  
 Additionally, IE 11 is not supported on Efecte Self-Service Portal starting from release 2021.1.  
 Microsoft has indicated that they encourage using their new Edge browser instead of IE11 and that they will only provide security fixes for IE11. Due to this, we are not able to make our ESM UI perform any better with the legacy IE11 browser without a major decrease in usability with other browsers. For this reason, we must focus our resources on improving the usability of modern browsers. The newest Microsoft Edge (Chromium) will be added to the list of our supported browsers.

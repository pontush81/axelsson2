  Problem statement 
The Efecte Service Management tool is getting more AI features to enable advanced and efficient use of the tool. These features should be possible to be set up quickly in a simple administrator UI.
 
Short description
ESM admins can now set up Effie AI Email and Effie AI Ticket (formerly known as Virtual Coach) in the same area of ESM UI, called Effie AI Settings. There are separate tabs for setting up the individual features. 
 
 
Use case details
Completely new UI is introduced for Effie AI Email. Administrators connect Effie AI Email with the desired Generative AI service provider and authenticate their account.
Admins then provide the instructions for how to instruct the generative AI. 
Admins can also choose, whether to allow the agents to select a language for the output of generative AI, and if they wish to allow including the email history on the ticket to additional context for the generative AI.
Finally, administrators select the template and email attributes where Effie AI Email should be available.
 
Note: See following documentation for keeping up with the changes and full configuration guide. The documentation will be updated after the new version is available.

Please note, that the condition editing capabilities are delayed and estimated now to be part of 2024.2 release.
Problem statement 
The new UI supports list views, but not view conditions and settings for filtering the data shown in the list views. Searching for information in is difficult without being able to filter data based on attribute values, and it is cumbersome to only use views created in the old UI for finding lists of information.
 
Short description
A new, improved view settings editor that allows users to filter relevant information to the views and applying settings to filter out data in views.
 
Use case details
The agent can filter views using settings and save the views. The agent can view existing conditions in the new editor, but not edit the attributes yet.

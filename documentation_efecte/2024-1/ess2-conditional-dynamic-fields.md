Problem statement
With form management, administrators want to build more dynamic forms for the end users to guide them in filling out issues correctly.
 
Short description
The administrator can configure conditional fields for the existing form fields so that end users get guided forms based on their selections.
 
Use case details
As an admin, I want to add conditions to my existing form fields to activate them on the ESS2 user interface based on the condition rules.
 
AC:

 the admin can add a condition to any form field or element
 the source field to activate the condition can be any short text or drop-down field
 condition has four operators to compare: ‘is equal to’, ‘is not equal to’, ‘exists’ or ‘not exists’
 on the ESS2 UI, if the condition is met, the field gets activated or deactivated based on the condition operator in use
 admin can configure up to ten source fields to single condition

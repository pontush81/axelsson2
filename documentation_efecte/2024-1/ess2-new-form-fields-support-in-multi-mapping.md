Problem statement
The administrator wants to map multiple Text area, Date, and Date&Time fields to a single ESM template attribute.
 
Short description
When adding a new Text area, Date, or Date&Time field to the form, the admin shall also be able to map them to the attribute, including other possible multi-mapped fields.
 
Use case details
As an admin, I want to map one or many Text areas, Date, or Date&Time fields to a single template attribute.
 
AC:

 the admin can map Text Area fields independently to dedicated attributes or to the field that is already used for the multi-mapping
 the admin can map Date fields independently to dedicated attributes or to the field that is already used for the multi-mapping
 the admin can map Date&Time fields independently to dedicated attributes or to the field that is already used for the multi-mapping

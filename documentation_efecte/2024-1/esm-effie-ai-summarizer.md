Problem statement
Support agents often need to extract important information from tickets or other data cards quickly without spending too much time browsing through content spread across multiple fields. 
 
Short description
Effie AI Summarizer helps agents extract information from a ticket quickly, produce high-quality text content with a single click, translate important content, or summarize ticket content for a specific audience.
 
Use case details
1. Effie AI Summarizer helps users to extract and generate information about open data cards in the new UI
2. Using generative AI, Effie AI Summarizer generates content from data based on the configured use cases, such as:
- Ticket handover: extract the most important information from a ticket.
- Replace vague ticket subjects with accurate ones with a single click.
- Translate text content or create summaries in a different language.
- Effortless documentation of resolutions.
3. Effie AI Summarizer is available where you need it the most
- Each use case is configured for a specific template.
- Administrators can define which attributes are used for generating the content.
- Administrators give specific prompt instructions for each use case, such as "Create a summary for support ticket handover" or "Create an accurate subject for an IT support ticket using provided data." For added value, administrators should define the use case in a very detailed level. 
4. Feature is provided as early access and free of charge to gain feedback for future development
-Configuration limit allows five use cases to be configured.
- Usage limit allows 1000 generated summaries per month.
- All data types, such as emails or data behind references, are not supported yet.

Documentation for configuring the feature will be available in Efecte Docs soon. If you have your own OpenAI account, or Azure tenant with OpenAI services, you can try out the Summarizer immediately after the upgrade, without additional cost.

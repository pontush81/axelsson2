 Problem statement   
 In the early access beta UI (ESM 2023.3), the datacard view currently offers a restricted range of supported functionalities. Unfortunately, one functionality currently missing is the ability to view references in an embedded reference table in the datacard view.   
  Short description  
 We are introducing an enhancement to address these issues. We plan to introduce support for reference tables within the newly implemented datacard view in the early access beta UI.   
  Use case details  
 On a high level, the functionality of the reference tables in the new datacard view will be similar to the current UI. However, we are introducing several improvements, such as:  
 
   Users can adjust the column width manually    
   Users can scroll both vertically and horizontally    
   The users can sort the results based on columns   
 The table width scales to the class width and utilizes the available space well 
   The admins can select whether the users can remove (unlink) a reference. Currently, there is a cross for unlinking the reference, which cannot be disabled.

Problem statement
Administrators want to publish information from the data card that the end users haven't entered while reporting an issue but are recorded by the system or agents during the handling process. Also, sometimes, there is a need to show issue details to end users, even if they are not created through any forms.
In addition to defining the presentation view for issues, admins want to understand what information is exposed to their end users when they open the case to a detailed view in ESS2.
Short description
With the "Case Presentation" -feature, admins can define a unified view per template for the ESS2 end users. Once the presentation view is generated, admins know the data they expose and, if needed, can add more attributes to end users' detailed view that are not filled through the form. Also, the case presentation adds the capability to define a view for the processes that are not initiated by any ESS2 form.
Use case details
As an admin, I can define case presentation views for those template that are exposed through the Open cases list view. 
AC:

 the admin can define a page title for a presentation view
 the admin can define a breadcrumb attribute for a presentation view
 the admin can define if comments and file attachments are enabled for case presentation view
 the admin can define which attributes are visible for end user when viewing detailed view of the open case
 to see the case presentation view for open cases, the issue shall be visible on Open Cases list view and the case presentation shall be active

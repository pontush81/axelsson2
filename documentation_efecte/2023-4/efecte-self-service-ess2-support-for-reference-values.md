 Problem statement  
 Environment administrators want to define form fields that include reference values so that end users would be prompted to ask for information that the environment already has defined as datacards, such as cost centers, locations, etc.  
  Short description  
 Having reference values in the forms on ESS2 UI, administrators shall be able to define the reference field from the target template as a form field. When end users are reporting an issue with the form where the reference field is selected as the form field, the chosen reference value shall be filled automatically in the created datacard.  
  Use case details  
 As an administrator, I want to create a drop-down from a reference attribute, so that I present relevant options to my end-users.  
 AC:  
 
 When adding a drop-down field or multi-select drop-down, admin can select reference attributes from the target template 
 Admin can preview the data 
 Admin can specify as a required field. 
 End-user can see and select one (or more) options in the new drop-down within the form, in the Self Service Portal UI.

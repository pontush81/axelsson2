 Problem statement   
 In the early access beta UI (ESM 2023.3), the datacard view currently offers a restricted range of supported handlers and functionalities. Unfortunately, one functionality that is currently only partially supported is the Worklog handler which is used for adding comments to datacards. Also, there is room for improvement related to the current user experience related to the Worklog handler.    
  Short description  
 We are introducing an enhancement to address these issues. We plan to introduce support for the Worklog handler within the newly implemented datacard view in the early access beta UI while improving the user experience.   
  Use case details  
 The functionality of the Worklog handler in the new datacard view will closely align with that of the current UI. However, we are improving the legibility of the comments and making the UI easier to use while renewing the user interface.

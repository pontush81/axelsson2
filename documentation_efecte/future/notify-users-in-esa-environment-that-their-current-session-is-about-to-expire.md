  Problem statement 
ESA ensures that user sessions are terminated when a configured timeout is reached, sometimes this leads to data lost if user has not saved the changes. 
 
Short description
We are introducing an enhancement to ESA session handling. ESA will notify users in ESM environment that their current session is about to expire in certain amount of time (e.g. 60 seconds)? 
 
Use case details
Popup window is displayed that tells to the end user that session is about to expire. User can Log out or continue session. Popup is optional and admin can define is it in use or not.

   This feature is for lobby personnel on managing visitors at company premises. Includes:  
 
 Host info, visitor info, arrival datetime, duration, arrival/no show buttons 
 Additionally car registration number for parking purposes and email notification for host on visitor arrival 
 Reports: upcoming visitors, calendar view, amounts of visitors in a timeframe 
 
 Lobby personnel are able to register visitor arrivals with a button that would notify the host via email, but also a list view showing phone number of host to call.  
 There is possibility to extend functionality with a calendar invite towards O365, using Efecte Integration Service, as a billable consulting task. Also, if there would be an SMS gateway in use, the notifications could be pushed as text messages there for the host person to receive.

ContentsKey features Improved usability and securityAutomation and provisioning capabilities The 2022.2 release of Efecte IGA is now available for all customers. This release's new functionalities help customers improve security, usability and time efficiency, with several enhanced provisioning features.  
Key features  
Improved usability and security 
 Login window UI renewal: The login window of Efecte IGA has now been redesigned to improve usability and experience for all users. A new login tab separates "company login" options from the "credential login" option. The tabs will only be visible when multiple login options are enabled.  
 Renewed Recertification:  This feature improves usability related to approval requests in Efecte Self-Service Portal, with well-structured information.  
 Password encryption: Passwords are encrypted in import and export files.  
Automation and provisioning capabilities 
 Immediate sync per user: When users are created in IGA or user information is updated, data is immediately synced between IGA and customer directory. This ensures that info is always accurate in the customer directory.  
 Targeted fetch of users for Azure AD: With this feature, scheduled provisioning time is reduced, as only users whose info has been updated are imported to IGA.  
 Creation of custom objects: this feature saves time from admin users by allowing the creation of user contact objects to AD, and also computers and printers.

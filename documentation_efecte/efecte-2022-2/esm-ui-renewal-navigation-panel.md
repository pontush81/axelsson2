 The second item on the Efecte Service Management Tool (ESM) UI renewal will be the left hand side navigation panel.  
 Needless to say the design will go through a refresh. A little more than the header.  
 We will get rid of the icons on each role. Currently they all are the same and have no meaning. They will be replaced by an expand icon that can be used to open the list of items included in the role or folder. The views will still have the icons but with a refreshed look (UI mock up below).  
   
 The bigger functional changes will be how the views are organized. We will introduce tabs for the navigation panel to decrease the amount of different views shown at once. Tabs will include roles, personal views, global views, folder, archive and trash. Visible tabs will follow the access rights.  
 Another functional improvement is the introduction of filter/search for the views.  
 The current features to create a new view and a dashboard will be still available behind buttons and with no additional mouse clicks compared to current state.

 As an ESS admin,  
 I want to enable delegations for everyone,  
 so that delegations can be assigned beforehand.  
AC: 
 
 A checkbox shall be added in ESS admin site under "Incident and Service Request settings" for enabling approval delegations 
   
   This checkbox shall be mutually exclusive with "Hide approval delegations" checkbox 
   When "Enable delegations for all" is chosen, "Hide Approval delegations" shall be disabled and greyed out 
   When "Hide approval delegations" is chosen, "Enable delegations for all" shall be disabled and greyed out 
    
 When enabled, all ESS end users shall be able to choose a deputy

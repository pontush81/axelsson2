ESM admin users could temporarily elevate their own credentials from their initials (upper right corner) to make necessary changes. This would reduce the use of full admin accounts and make the system more secure for both Matrix and the customer.
It would also improve usability for admin users, who often operate the system entirely with admin rights and are unable to demonstrate how the system appears to a regular user with limited permissions.

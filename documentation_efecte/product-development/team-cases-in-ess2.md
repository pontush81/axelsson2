As a team member when I am viewing cases in the Self-Service Portal I want to have an additional view for Team Cases separate from My Cases so that I can easily see all cases that are visible to my team (i.e., to users who share the same manager according to the Person card, which is synchronized from Active Directory).
Event: A user opens the Self-Service Portal Condition: The user belongs to a group of employees with the same manager (based on Person card / Active Directory) Action: A new tab or view labeled Team Cases is available next to My Cases.
Event: The user selects Team Cases Condition: The system filters cases visible to all users who share the same manager Action: The list displays only those cases, excluding personal ones.
Event: A new case is created by another team member Condition: The case visibility is determined by the same manager relationship Action: The case automatically appears in the Team Cases view for all members of that team.
Event: The manager relationship changes in Active Directory Condition: The Person card is updated accordingly Action: The Team Cases view dynamically updates to include or exclude cases based on the new hierarchy.

Use Case: In a hospital environment, employees from the same team work in different shifts. An error affecting everyone is first reported by a staff member on the night shift. When the morning shift begins, another employee can check the Team Cases view, see that the issue has already been reported, and avoid creating a duplicate case. This helps reduce redundant tickets and ensures faster coordination across shifts.

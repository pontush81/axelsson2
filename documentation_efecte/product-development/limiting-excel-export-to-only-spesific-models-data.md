Excel export is a handy tool for listing Matrix42 ESM data outside the system. Unfortunately, it also poses a security risk, as some data should only remain within ESM.
Would it be possible to restrict data export to specific datasets? For example, disabling exports of personal data cards while allowing only incidents and CMDB data to be exported.
On a larger scale, could Excel export be disabled from everyone in admin settings by Efecte admin or Excel export be limited based on ESM user roles?
 
Additionally, current logging is not sufficient: it only records who performed the export, but not which datasets were exported.

   Here you can add, vote, and comment ideas for features.  
 We will take a snapshot of the votes roughly when we release a cloud upgrade and we are drafting the roadmap item for the cloud upgrade 6 months ahead.  
 We suggest you use the agile development practise to describe your idea as a story. Your story should include at least one user story and several acceptance criteria which serve as test criteria.   
 For the user story, you may want to follow this format which we use inside of Efecte:  
 
  
   "As <who> <when> <where>, I <want> because <why>"  
   "As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>"  
   For acceptance criteria, I suggest you do describe testable requirements in a format of event, condition, and action.  
  
 
 Please note: The main purpose of this section in the community portal is to share ideas inside of the community, improve them, and create momentum for these by voting for them.  
 Efecte's Product Managers may transfer ideas that have gotten a lot of positive feedback to its roadmap given commercial feasibility to implement them.  
 If you want to make a direct feature request to Efecte, you want to get into commercial dialogue to implement such, and you would like to follow the progress of such feature request online, then please contact the service desk by email or phone.

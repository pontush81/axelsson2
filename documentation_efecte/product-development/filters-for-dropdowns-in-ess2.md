We have an issue that I think would bee appreciated by others if it could be solved. If you have a drop down field with lets say buildings.
And then you have a drop down with access areas for all the buildings in the first drop down.
 
I I choose the first building in the first drop down, the i should only get the access areas belonging to that building.
And if I can do that filtering directly in that form would be really nice.
Maybe this is possible in some other way but I have not found it yet.

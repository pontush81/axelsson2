 User story:  
 As an administrator, I want to create very specific queries in the self-service portal to obtain data from ESM, so that no unnecessary data gets presented to the end-users.  
 Example: Show only access rights that belong to the organisation I'm a member of.  
  
 AC:  
 - administrators can add a filtering query to a MyServices field configuration

We currently lack the ability to click and drag attached files directly from a data card to an external file area or into another system’s file upload interface.
In many cases, we receive tickets with attachments that need to be imported into another system. The current functionality requires users to first download the file locally and then manually drag it from IE into the other system. This adds unnecessary extra steps and workload.
We propose implementing a drag-and-drop feature that allows users to move attachments directly from M42 to other destinations without the need to download them first. This would streamline the workflow and improve efficiency.

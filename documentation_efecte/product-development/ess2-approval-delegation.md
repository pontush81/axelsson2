Hi!
Many crucial functions in ESS2 are coming along for us to contemplate migrating our forms. I guess the recent increase in activity for new ideas from the community is a good indicator that we're not alone in thinking it might soon be possible. However, for us and our end-users there are still festures missing, important enough to force us to continue to wait expectantly (impatiently).
Forms for product items in 2025.2 will be a welcome and crucial addition, but for our approvers to be able to delegate an approval is just as important. So I guess my question for now is, when can we expect these features?
I would not be surpriced if a ESS2 release with sufficient features is at the very top of your customers wish list, I know it is for us. 
 
Kind regards

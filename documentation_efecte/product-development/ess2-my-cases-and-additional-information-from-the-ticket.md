We would like the ability to view additional ticket details without opening the ticket in the "My Cases" view. Currently, for open tickets, there is no way to see the ticket content without clicking to open it, and for closed tickets, only the resolution is visible.
We hope the feature would work so that the administrator can define which fields are displayed when additional ticket details are expanded using the arrow.

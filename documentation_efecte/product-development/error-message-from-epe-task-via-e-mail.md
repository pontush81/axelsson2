So far, EPE Task - for fetching AD data from emplyees or else - offers the option to create an error datacard. We tried that mechanism with customer and realized, that everytime one error happens, one and always teh same - in this case incident datacard - got creasted. 
That did not create Wows on customerside as treating with these incidents ment creating some kind of internal ESM logic, which costs resources. 
Customers expectation would have ben to get that error message not as datacard creation but as an email sent to a customer specific address in order to use exchange out-of-the-box mechanisms to deal with the messages.
So  customer''s expectaion was here to get an optionto send EPE import errors via email. When can that be set up?

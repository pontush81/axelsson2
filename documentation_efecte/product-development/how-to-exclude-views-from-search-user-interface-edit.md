"Search from views" is handy. Our problem is that ESM has been in use for quite some time, and there are multiple similar views that are almost identical but needed for different points of view.
Could you add a button to exclude some views from this "search of views" column?
(For example, the line that includes "laite", meaning device.)
The exclude button would be custom for the current user and saved to the user's custom preferences.

As a user, it would help me to have certain values in a view formatted eg in bold or red, so I can immediately see if there are certain elements that need my attention urgently.
For example, I would love to have numbers in a column in red, if a certain value is exceeded. 
As an administrator, I would like to have to possibility to configure this for each attribute per template by using rules that define the look of the values. Several rules can be applied. And also, it would be great to be able to sort and filter upon thos conditionally formatted values.

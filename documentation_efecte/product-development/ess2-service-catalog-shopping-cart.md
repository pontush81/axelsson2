Hello all
We are waiting impatiently for the possiblity to add several items to a shopping cart, including the possiblity to select from given versions of an article. For instance, a user wants to order a new mobile phone, and there's an option for e.g. black, white, silver and/or 126GB, 256GB or 512 GB memory. And in addition, the user wants to order a new keyboard as well.
As of now, this is not possible. In fact, when using the Service catalogue in ESS2, the user clicks on an item and then the order instantly is beeing transferred to a service request ticket. No way to add comments, delivery addresses, date requirements, amount of articles and so on.
For us, unfortenately, the service catalogue is not published, because it's not yet usable for us without those features. If a ticket is beeing created instantly, the user isn't happy about - and we (the IT) aren't neither.
So my question:
Is there anyone else sharing these thoughts? And: Are there any plans to improve the catalogue feature? As of now, we have to create a form for every orderable article, and there, we don't have the possiblity to add pictures.
Thanks to all!
Oli

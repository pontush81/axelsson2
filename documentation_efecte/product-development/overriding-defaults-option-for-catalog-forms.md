Hello,
 
using ESS2 Portal, there is quite a handy option for General Forms, called "Ovverride Defaults". You can send information to the template and pre-set drop-downs and thus quite easily show fields only, when a certain type is choosen.
Lately, the catalgoue forms got released and that is a pretty good feature to have more options in the cataloge. Unfortunately, there is no such thing called ovverride defaults as it is given on general forms.
At least I havn't found anything and here - as i believe - as cataloge forms show logically the funciton as a general form, I miss the ovveride default option here on cataloge form. Is there a reason for it? Is it planned when if so, when to be released?
I think it would massively help the admin and avoid on-top logic in case of cataloge forms...

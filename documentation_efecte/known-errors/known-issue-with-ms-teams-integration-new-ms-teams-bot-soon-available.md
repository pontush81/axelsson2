Contents✅ What’s the solution?💡 Supported Use Cases (New Bot)⚙️ Prerequisites🗓️ Availability and PricingWe want to inform you about a known issue affecting the current MS Teams integration with Matrix42 ITSM environments.
Recently, we’ve received reports that the existing MS Teams bot has stopped functioning. The issue is due to a technical limitation in the old MS Teams bot, which does not support TLS 1.3. 

✅ What’s the solution?
We’ve developed a new MS Teams bot that resolves this issue and offers improved functionality. Pilots are starting soon, and we’re planning a gradual rollout to all interested customers with the current MS Teams bot in use over the coming months.
💡 Supported Use Cases (New Bot)
The new MS Teams bot supports a wide range of collaboration scenarios:
🔔 Notifications:
Ticket creation and updates can be sent:

 To a Teams channel (per group)
 To a private chat (per person)

📝 Ticket Handling

 Create tickets from private Teams conversations
 Add comments from ESM to Teams 
 Fetch list of tickets assigned to the person

Live chat:

 In private chats
 In channels


⚙️ Prerequisites
Some actions are required to enable the new bot:
🧑💼 Microsoft Teams Admin Work
The customer’s Teams admin needs to:

 Manually upload the app package (15-minute task). Note: The bot is not yet listed in the MS Teams app store.

🌐 Network Configuration

 In the case of private cloud deployments, port openings are required to connect to the MS Teams bot. 


🗓️ Availability and Pricing

 The pilot phase is underway
 General rollout to existing customers using the current MS Teams integration  is planned in the upcoming months
 No additional cost for replacing the old bot and using the same features
 New features (e.g. AI Knowledge capabilities) involve additional usage, license and implementation fees. 
 The potential costs (implementation/usage) for new customers (with no existing MS Teams integration in place) will be communicated separately.

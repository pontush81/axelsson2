 After initial investigation we have concluded that the Efecte stack is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228. This is due to several reasons, depending on software project, which are: - We use JDK with configuration that mitigates the vulnerability - We use log4j 1.2.x without JMS appender - We use other libraries for logging We will continue to investigate the effect of this vulnerability on the Efecte stack, to rule out other possible attack vectors. Efecte will also investigate the feasibility to upgrade log4j 1.2 to log4j 2.15, or newer, in H1/2022.

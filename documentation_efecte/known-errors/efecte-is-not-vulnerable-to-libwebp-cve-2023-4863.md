Several customers have contacted us that their Efecte environment includes the LibWebP library, which has recently been listed as a high risk component with any application using it.
Our Efecte solutions does not use the LibWebP library.
The LibWebP library is included in the default package we use as a basis for our software. Still, Efecte does not directly use it in any functionality and therefore does not have the vulnerability related to the component. Our next version will include the updated library, as the default package we use will get the update. We are not modifying the default package by removing the library in the near future because it will be updated by the package maintainer.

Uploading a New Solution 
 When uploading a new community solution, we ask you to please start a new topic in this section (Community Created Solutions). This post should include a brief description, all of the included XML files, and a factsheet providing other users with basic information about the solution.  
 We have provided a word template for your use to make creating factsheet even simpler. Please see the factsheets for Enterprise Contract Management or Essential SAFe for examples of use.  
 When a new solution is posted, Efecte will take the responsibility of creating a dedicated folder for the solution, as with Enterprise Contract Management and Essential SAFe, and moving the uploaded documents to this location.  
Uploading a Revision/ Update 
 When uploading a revised or improved version of an existing solution, we ask that you please upload the necessary XML files, an updated factsheet with the improvements listed in the table of Section 3, and a brief description to inform other community members of the developments.  
 If the revision or improvement consists of large changes, developments, or a change of focus, we ask you to please upload this as a new solution. An example of this could be modifying the Enterprise Contract Management Solution for Financial Contract Management.  
Discussions and Questions Surrounding Community Solutions  
 If you have any questions or comments about any community solution, we ask you to please add them to the original post to improve visibility and collaboration.

Hello!, is there a source condition, which checks the old value of an attribute gainst a new one?
Usecase would be to check if:
old status value is "01 - New"
new status value is "02 - Waiting for implementation"
==> trigger an action
 
I found the property source condition, but here it is only possible to check if the attribute was updated...

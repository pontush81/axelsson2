Hello community
Does anyone have this issue as well?
It happens too often that there are no values listed in dropdowns. This can be solved by refreshing the browser tab (F5) and/or deleting the history (stange: deleting cookies does not help).
We're not sure yet, but it could be that this only is valid for dropdowns based on static values (not for references). As it's nearly impossible to reproduce this and it does not happen all the time, maybe someone of you has an idea.
Since yesterday, we have version 2025.1 and we will see, if this issue still is there. Our default browser is Edge, but other browsers also sometimes don't want to work properly. We're using Windows11 machines. Both, browser and windows are up-to-date.
Thanks!
Oli

Situation: ESM baseline from pre-Ticket era with "Incident" and "ServiceRequest" templates. When I want to change the password of a local user, and do it on the ESM Admin side, will that be propagated to ESA, or will I end up with different passwords on the "ESA login screen" and then have to re-authenticate on the ESM "blue" login screen using the new password? 
If the latter, what is the recommended sequence for changing the password of a local user in pre-Ticket baseline (without pre-configured support for local user handling)?

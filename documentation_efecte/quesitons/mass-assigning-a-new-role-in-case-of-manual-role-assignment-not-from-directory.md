If a customer uses "manual" role assignment, is there a possibility to "mass assign" a newly created role to "most" ESM users? Apart from the "old" Admin UI klicking each user into the newly created role? With a 4-digit number of ESM users that takes a while... Any guidance on how to "mass assign" the new role would be highly appreciated.

Anyone aware of a complete list of "things" that can be used in expressions and scripts for attribute logic? E.g. "getTemplateCode" is sometimes very useful when sharing things across multiple templates and then having to differentiate on which template I currently operate, like:
_template = this.getTemplateCode()
Is there anywhere a complete documentation or list of things that can be used "behind a 'this.' "?

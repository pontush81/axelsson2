Hi, tried to work on ESS2 Catalog Froms and would appreciate to be switch of some attributes and thus classes if not triggered using the enable-if function.
Funny enough, after configuration the values from catalogue form were not populated in SR any more.... So, I re-build teh enable-if and WITHOUT the values from cataloge form were there again.
 
Is there a reason for enable-if not woking on cataloge forms?

Hello,
customer wants to see only free IP Adresses when assinging them to a device.
I am looking for best practice here and think about to go with back reference from device to network information with a full save on data card option. Thus triggering a Listener on network device template to set the status if CI is related. Is there some kind of "best practice" known?

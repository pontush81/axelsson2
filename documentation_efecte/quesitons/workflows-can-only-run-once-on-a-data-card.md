Hello all
A couple of years ago, when we implemented Efecte, we have been told that a workflow only can run one single time on a certain datacard. Does this limitation still exist?
Here's an example of a requirement that made me think of doing it with a workflow, but then I remembered that limitation:
In datacard ABC, some one selects a flag "Send mail?" to "Yes. The workflow's trigger is this flag set to "Yes", so the workflow starts and sends out a mail. Then, the workflow sets the Flag to "No". This would make sure that the mail only will be sent out when the user wants it to be sent.
A couple of days later, the user then again needs to send out that mail in datacard ABC, so the flag is set to "Yes" again, expecting the workflow to run a second time.
But that won't work, right? Due to that limitation?
If so, I think I will suggest the product development to change this. I'm familiar with Sharepoint workflows, and those can run on a single item with no limits.
Thanks to all!
Oli

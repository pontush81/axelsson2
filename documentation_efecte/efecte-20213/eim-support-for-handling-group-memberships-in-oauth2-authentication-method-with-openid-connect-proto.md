 Earlier it has been possible to create users "on-the-fly" based on attributes received in authentication in IDtoken. This feature enables now also to grant users access rights based on groups present in IDtoken.   
  
 Groups and other json arrays in IDtoken can now be handled in eventrules. In this scenario EIM acts as a Service Provider (SP) and authentication is OAuth2 with OpenID Connect protocol.

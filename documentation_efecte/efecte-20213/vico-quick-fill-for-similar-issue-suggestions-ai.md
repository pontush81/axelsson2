 User Story:  
 As a service management tool user, I want to be able to copy and paste values of selected attributes from a similar issue to the issue I'm editing currently which helps me to process the issue faster.  
 ACs:  
 
 users with edit permission can click on a Quick-fill button displayed in the Virtual Coach area beside each similar issue that is displayed 
 the service management tool copies the values of the corresponding attributes from a similar issue to the current issue 
 administrators can configure for each template on which attributes shall be copied in the metadata of the attribute 
 
 Note: The Virtual Coach functionality is a licensable feature.

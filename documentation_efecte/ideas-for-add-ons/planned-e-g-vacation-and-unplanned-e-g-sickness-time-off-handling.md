 As an ESM Agent I want to "record" my own time-off periods in the system, so that during these periods no new work gets assigned to me. In addition I would like to be able to "temporarily re-assign" my work during my absence to either a colleague or "my team".  
 As an additional requirement, in case of sickness, a colleague of mine, or my manager should be able to enter a "time-off period" on my behalf, again, with the option to temporarily re-assign my work to either a colleague or "my team".

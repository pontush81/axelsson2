 Some of the UI-fields are too short, which makes the managing work harder. Following fields have been identified to be too short in some use cases: - On Assignment types tab "Information", Name field - On Assignment types tab "Tasks", Task name - On Assignment type view, Name - On Task types view, Task name - On Task types tab "Information", Name field - On Assignments view, Name - On Roles tab "Information", Display name - On Roles tab "Information", Name We will add possibility to configure above mentioned fields (each separately) to use wrap functionality instead of fixed length. Please let us know if there is other fields that should be included in this change.

   We will start to update the Workspace UI with small steps. The first planned update is in the header of the Service Management Tool (see the UI mockup picture). The biggest changes are that we will make it appear consistent across all the pages and add the much-requested feature of configurable Create-New buttons to it.  
 Planned features:  
 
 page header must be the same for workspace, background data, and administration UI 
   
   Search results shall always be displayed in the workspace UI 
   Page header shall be less high than in the current normal layout 
    
 page header must be the same for compact layout and normal layout 
 navigating to and from the admin UI is done using small icons instead of a tab bar or drop-down selection in the profile menu 
   
   Icons to Admin UI and Background data UI shall only be displayed if the user has the required permissions 
    
 the profile icon shall display the abbreviation of the user's first name and surname 
   
   the background color of the profile icon can be customized based on system settings 
    
 it shall be possible for users to add multiple Create-New buttons to the page header 
   
   Create-New button icon consists always of a plus sign icon and template icon 
   Create-New buttons choices can be added in a multi-value field on the profile settings 
   Create-New buttons are shown in the desktop UI besides the search input area 
   The background color for Create-New Button can be customized through the system settings 
    
 the company logo in the header can be customized by the system settings

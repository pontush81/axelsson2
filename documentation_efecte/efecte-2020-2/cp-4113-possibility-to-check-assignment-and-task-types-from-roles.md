 Currently it is possible to go from assignments to tasks and from tasks to roles. It would help management work, if it would be possible to what type of task system role is and the type of task and the types of assignment it has. There should be additional tab for roles which would show which task types role is linked to (and these should be clickable links that would take user to the linked task type). From task type you should be able to see which assignment types the task is linked to.  
AC:s 
 
 From role should be able to see which tasks it is linked to (and move through a link to the linked task)  
 From task should be able to see which assignment types it is linked to (and move through a link to the linked assignment type) 
 There should be translations done for the new tab 
 This functionality should be available only for users with sufficient access rights 
 
  
 After implementing support for role we also evaluate implementing support for role groups and agent groups.

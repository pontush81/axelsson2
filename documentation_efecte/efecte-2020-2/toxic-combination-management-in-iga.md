 User story:  
 As an Access Manager, I want to be able to prevent the automated granting of certain permission combinations in order to comply with internal access rights policies.  
  
 ACs:  
 - Efecte IGA can manage toxic combinations after the request has been made on the Self-Service Portal - Access Managers can store forbidden permission combinations in a dedicated template - once a access right change request has been made in the Self-Service Portal, the workflow, implemented as Visual Workflow Automation in the Service Management Tool, will check whether a restriction rule exists and check if the requested combination is toxic i.e. not allowed - There are possibilities to notify the requester by email and terminate the workflow - There are possibilities to request approval from one or several managers to bypass the toxic combination restriction - There is a possibility to create a report on toxic combinations and toxic combination requests

 User Story:  
 As a service management tool user, I want the tool to suggest not only possibly matching categories using AI but also subcategories at the same time in order to speed up the classification of the issue.  
 Implementation:  
 The feature will be enabled in two phases. First, we will enable using the ReferenceCopy handler to allow filling fields based on the first level categorisation, or any other reference attribute.  This will be available in the 2021.4 release.  
 The next phase is to implement the functionality in a way that the second level categorisation would be a separate suggestion. This is planned for 2022.

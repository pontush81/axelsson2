Problem statement
ESM allows building URL links to an attribute using ExternalLinkParameter handler, based on attribute values set on configured attributes. This allows support agents to use less time browsing for information, as links can be built for them automatically. This feature is being brough to the new Agent UI, to make that support even more sophisticated use cases.

Problem statement
The self-service needs a place to share news and updates on critical ongoing issues or inform employees of upcoming important business solution updates.
 
Short description
The self-service user interface shall provide a place where the end users can easily see topical announcements so that they don't need to burden the service desk with cases related to ongoing maintenance. 
 
Use case details
As an end-user, I want to see announcements in ESS2 so that I am aware of important (topical) information. As an admin, I want to set the template and attributes used for announcements so that they will be displayed in ESS2.
 
AC:

 A new section is introduced in Self Service admin, under Forms & Pages, titled ‘Announcements’
 Admin can configure announcements in ESS2 admin
 Admin can select the template used for announcements in ESS2
 The creator of the announcement can add rich text content
 On the Announcements list view columns are Subject, Date Published, and Expected Resolution (per defined in ESM)

6.    On the portal, all users can see all published and not expired announcements in a list of announcements, which can be navigated to from the top navigation.

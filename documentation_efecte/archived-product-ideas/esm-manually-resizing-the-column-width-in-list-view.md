 As a user I want to be able to adjust and save the width of text and string columns in the list view in order to optimise the content fitting on my display.  Any user that can edit views must be able to change column width of column containing text or strings by drag&drag from column separator line. Drag&drop shall stop at minimum width even if user tries to limit the width even further wrapping of attribute name or truncating it shall not be supported. The user must be able to save the column width configuration with the rest of the list view configuration can be saved with role-specific view, personal view and public view.

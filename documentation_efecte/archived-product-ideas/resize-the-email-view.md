 As a user of ESM I would like to be able to resize the email view so that I can: * get an overview of all the emails that have been exchanged in the ticket in one pane. * Have a larger view in which to read and compose emails.  
 Working with emails in the EntityStateMail view in the data card it is hard to get an overview of the conversation since the window is so small. We would like to be able to resize the window, either with an attribute or let the user resize the window themselves.

   As  a user, when typing into a rich text field, the line break behaviour isn't  user friendly. I cannot see what was written at the right side without using the scroll bars. In the example picture, after the "solut", there's more text.  
 This is not related to the browser used, it happens in all browsers.  
 I'd love to be able to switch off the scroll bars or to have another solution to be able to see the complete text on every line.

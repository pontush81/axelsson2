ContentsUser story:ACs:User story: 
 As a system administrator I want that some fields are only shown to the user depending on attributes and their values in order to display only fields that are relevant for a particular scenario.  
ACs: 
 
 every attribute shall have a setting called "Display if" with a drop-down selection of all attributes with data type String with static values in the template 
 if the administrator selects an attribute to "Display if", then an additional field with a drop-down selection shall be shown below the "Display if" field 
   
   the drop-down selection shall be shown after reloading the page (like for Reference selections) 
   the administrator can select one or many static values 
    
 the conditional attribute shall be displayed in the location wherever placed in the template layout once the user, a workflow, or an expression sets the value on the trigger field to one of the required values 
   
   visibility settings (visible in edit mode, hide) shall be adhered to

 As an ESM user, I would like to be able to view the full source of each email in an incident, so that I can view the mail headers to check for spam and mail routing.  
 We would like a way from within the ESM interface to be able to view the whole email with source and mail headers. This would help us verify the correctness of a mail, to be able to update our spam-rules and troubleshoot different mail related problems.

   Efecte 2019.1 has now general availability and it's time to publish the Q4 roadmap. The community feedback will play an important role in selecting the Q4 enhancements.  
 The most liked product idea was: Support Groups Button Even when Assigned to Multiple Support Groups with 15 votes.  
 The most viewed product idea was: Kanban View with 33 views.  
  
 We in Efecte's Product Management will do now the usual effort versus benefit/strategy/competition/industry analysis and see whether we can implement these and if not whether we can do some other feature from the top 7 product ideas voted by the community. In regards to Kanban view we do have already a work estimate. In regards to Support Groups Button feature, we need to do a work estimate still. Stay tuned for a first roadmap update tomorrow.

 User story:  
 As a Service Provider I want to be able to price service items in the self-service portal differently based on the customer in order to tailor for different business agreements.  
  
 ACs:  
 
 it should be possible to define different prices for a service catalog item in the service management tool according to the organisation the customer belongs to 
 the self-service portal shall display the customer-specific price according to the OU parameter registered for the end user

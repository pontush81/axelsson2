 Hello,  
 we would like to have more than one attachment field in templates. E.g. in an incident template you have normally the attachment field in in incident description section, so that the user can send you attachments or screen shots.  
 Very often we want to send him an attachment when resolving the ticket, but there is no attachment field, because in the template you can only have one attachment field. So support person has to send an extra email to the customer with the attachment and then sets the ticket in the status resolved and the customer gets a 2nd email.  
 The other thing is, that sometimes in incident analysis the support wants to write a comment in the ticket and wants to attach a screen shot to his comment. Also this isn't possible, because of the restriction of one attachment field.  
 Would be helpful if you could implement this (also in the other templates).

 In IT Service Team, I want to have a list view, where I can see my Incidents, Problems, Service Requests and Changes in one list view. And I want to be able to configure, what should be included in the list.  
 Of course you can build a dashboard. But then you have only a small frame and don't see much columns. And additionally you don't have the full functionality, when opening tickets via dashboard (e.g. no Transform-Functions).

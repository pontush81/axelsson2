Problem statement
Currently, in the new Agent UI, service desk agents cannot easily view the history of e.g. teams that have handled a ticket, making it difficult to identify and contact individuals with valuable insights into the issue. This lack of visibility impacts the efficiency of issue resolution.

Use case details

 Data from attributes with ValueChangeMonitor handler is always shown in a Reference table in the new UI

Problem statement
It is not currently possible for the administrator to define access group limitations to product catalog items. Once the Catalog is defined, it has global access.
 
Short description
To set up access groups for catalog items, the configuration for role-based access shall support setting also product items to existing Access Groups on self-service administration. Once admins define the access groups for product items, they shall be applied to end users for limiting content based on given rules.
 
Use case details
As an admin, I want to control access to product items at the same place where I control access to Forms, Panels, Panel groups, and URLs. Access Groups for product items shall extend the current configuration of the access groups.
 
AC:

 On the ESS2 admin pages of Access Groups shall be new area to configure catalogue access.
 The tab shall be named Catalog and is next to Category Management tab when configuring single Access Groups entry
 The configurations shall be done on the Catalog item level
 In case the item is added to multiple categories, end user shall have access to an item through all categories.

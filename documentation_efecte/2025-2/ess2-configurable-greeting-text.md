Problem statement
Sometimes, the greeting text on the home page doesn’t meet the company’s visual policy, and therefore, it needs to be customized or removed.
 
Short description
Self-service administrator should be able to either remove greeting text or modify the text that is shown before the name. 
 
Use case details
As a self-service administrator, I want to customize the greeting text that is visible above the search bar.
AC:

 As an admin, I want to be able to modify the greeting text. 
 Admins can override the default text. Altered greeting text does not use translations
 Username (as received from the identity provider e.g. EPE/ESA), is always appended to the greeting text
 Admin can enable or disable the greeting

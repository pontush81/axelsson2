Problem statement
When making an order from the product catalog, the end user would like to provide, for example, a delivery address for a single-item order. However, since there are no fields to set such a thing, the end user needs to send additional information about the order as comments directly to the open issue or via email.
 
Short description
To properly handle the ordered item, the support team needs to gather important additional information about the requested item directly in the created case. The self-service administrator should be able to create a standard form with fields visible for defined product items in the catalog.
 
Use case details
As an admin, I want to give my end-users the ability to provide extra information or choices on an SR/Product Order so that we gather the necessary information when an item is ordered.
 
AC:

 On the ESS2 admin/Catalog & Orders/Presentation tab, an admin can specify a Catalog Form that will be applied to defined item in the Catalog
 This form can be accessed by anybody who can view the Catalog and SRs/Product Items.
 Data is stored in the generated Order data card.
 Conditions can be added to form fields.
 The catalog form can only be referenced under Catalog & Orders/Presentation, and no other process
 Override defaults are not supported on catalog forms

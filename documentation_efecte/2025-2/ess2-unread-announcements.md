Problem statement
End users cannot separate new comments from those they have read earlier. Also, the notification badge icon stays on top of the announcements icon even if the user has read all announcements.
 
Short description
The browser shall know whether the end-user has read the announcement and indicate whether there are unread comments on the list of announcements.
 
Use case details
As an end user, I want to see if there are new announcements so that I don’t always need to navigate to the Announcement page. If I’ve seen new announcement, it should be marked as read.
 
AC:

 The number of unread announcements is indicated with number indicator (badge) on the top navigation
 On the list of announcements, the unread announcements are bolded, until they are opened
 On the list of announcements, the user can mark all as read
 Read announcements don’t carry over to different browsers and devices.
 The status of the announcement (read or unread) is not shared between different users on the same browser or device.

I have a problem with e-mail formats in Efecte. 
Case:
1. New e-meil message is sent to a receiver (user) from a Efecte ticket. html format enabled. Message includes a pasted image and some text. All ok.
2. Reveiver (user) reads the message in Outlook. Text and pasted image are shown normally in the message content. He replys  and pastes another image to the message. All ok.
3. Looking at the ticket  in Efecte, the message from the receiver includes all the content. Original message and the replied message. Images and text are all in place in the message. All ok.
4. Now replying to latest received message, format of the message is in PLAIN text and not anymore HTML!  All the pasted images are gone because of message format -> problem. 
 
Is there any setting or workaround how to maintain the format as Html also when replying to e-meil message in Efecte? Or is this just a bug? Our Efecte version is 2023.4.5 (on-premise)

Hello everyone
Perhaps I am the only one who repeatedly encounters issues when creating matrix expressions or listeners. I am not a programmer (anymore; I used to be one a long time ago), but I still have a basic understanding of how programming works. 
However, since this is not my daily work, I repeatedly encounter problems when coding expressions, and listeners. And that costs me a lot of time.
I would like to have a “snippet” collection, i.e., examples of common use cases, both for expressions and for listeners. It would be nice to have these examples in easy-to-understand pseudo-code PLUS in the actual language. Easy-to-understand attribute names could be used for this.
Of course, it would be great if, after coding an expression, I didn't have to look in the log to see what was wrong, but instead had kind of console window that showed me the errors directly. Sort of debugging mode. Probably not feasible for listeners, but for expressions...?
Then, as input for our matrix friends:
Because something like the above is missing (for me, at least), more detailed documentation would be helpful. The existing documentation is often very minimal, with few or no examples.
Thanks, everyone!

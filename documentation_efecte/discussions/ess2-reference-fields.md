I tested reference fields on ESS2 forms. I added drop down menus and selected reference to different attributes such as support group, category, and service. But when testing the form at ESS2 all those drop down menus show "No records found".
Do I need to make some changes to current classes so that they are visible and can be used for different fields in ESS2?
Is it possible to limit available options inside one attribute, e.g. if drop down menu refers to "Support group" the end user can only select support group A or B even though there are more support groups in ESM?

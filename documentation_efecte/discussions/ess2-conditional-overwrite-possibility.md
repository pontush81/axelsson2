As an administrator, I would love to have the possibility to use the form's override function based on values the user selected in the form. At the moment, we just can overwrite something or not.
For example: If the user select "value1" from a dropdown list, the ticket should be assigned to "support group1", if the user selects "value2", we should overwrite the support group value with "support group2", in any other case, we could overwrite with support group "Standard".

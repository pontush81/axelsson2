Hey guys,
I've got a simple question, but I cannot find any solution based on ESS. Maybe you can support with an answer. Thanks in advance.
User story As a service catalog manager, I would like to publish the service catalog via efecte so that every consumer in the company can find out about the services that are relevant to them.
Acceptance criteria

 Services are listed in an entry view
 Services are filterable by selected attributes
 Services are prefiltered by user's company (user is logged in) that is permitted to consume, prefilter can be actived by logged in user for entire service catalog (list)
 Selected service informations in formats like text, chosen options, dates, support contact etc.) from the entry in the service catalog (ESM CMDB service template) appear in a service description (list of attributes is required)
 Service offerings are linked for self service in ESS below the service description

How would you solve this requirement with ESS? Best regards Christian

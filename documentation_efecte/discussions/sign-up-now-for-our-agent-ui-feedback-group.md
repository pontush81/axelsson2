Hi everyone,
 
We're looking for active users interested in shaping the future of the new Agent UI on ESM, powering Matrix42 Core and Pro solutions, to join our early adopters' feedback group. We will start a recurring feedback group call in August, lasting until December, to engage with the user base about the latest plans. We have room for 10 customers, and a maximum of two people can be invited from each customer.
 
If you're open to joining the group in a 1-hour monthly call to share feedback on upcoming features and share your recent experiences, we’d love to have you on board. It’s a great chance to get early insights, help influence our roadmap, and make sure your voice is heard in the development of our platform.
 
If this sounds like something you'd be up for, let me know in the comments below or sign up using this form so we can invite you. There are only a limited number of seats, so secure your seat now! The seats will be shared in the order of signups, and participation will be confirmed via personal invitation by July 4th.
 
Thanks for your interest!

Hi everyone,
We’ve been working on a custom-built SAM (Software Asset Management) solution within Efecte to manage our software portfolio. While it covers some of our basic needs, we’re aware that it’s far from being a complete or robust SAM solution. There are several limitations, and we’re finding it hard to meet all our compliance and license management requirements using this setup.
That got us thinking — is there any plan from Efecte or through the Matrix42 integration to offer a standalone, dedicated SAM module that can be fully implemented?  
We’d love to know if this is something already in development, on the roadmap, or even available as an integration we might have missed.
Looking forward to hearing from the community or the product team if there’s something in the pipeline!
Best, Jeremy

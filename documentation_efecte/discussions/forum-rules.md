 Please do use English for your posts:   
 
 Efecte has customers anywhere on the globe and tapping into the knowledge of the entire community makes the conversation open for everybody. 
 
 No Abuse, Insults or Personal Attacks  
 
 Abuse, insults and personal attacks directed at any member, person, or group are unacceptable. If you disagree with someone on some point, please do not resort to name calling or personal attacks; instead, argue the merits of their points. Please note that attacking people you perceive to be "trolls", "fanbois" or "flame baiters" still counts as a personal attack, and your posts will be removed as such. 
 
 No Foul Language  
 
 The use of foul language is considered to be unacceptable. Posts with inappropriate language will be removed. 
 
 No Trolling  
 
 A post that is solely intended to incite controversy or conflict, or cause annoyance or offense is considered "trolling". These posts will only lead to personal attacks and emotional outbursts from other members, which results in an unhealthy atmosphere. 
 
 No Inappropriate or Illegal Material  
 
 Do not post or add in your signature anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, illegal, etc. Political and religious topics are considered inappropriate as well. Attaching, posting links to, or otherwise promoting pirated or illegal software is contrary to the purposes of the community and its forum. 
 
 No Business Advertising  
 
 Creating threads, posts, or signatures that serve solely to promote your business (whatever that may be, personal blogs excluded) is not allowed. Referral links and viral marketing are not allowed. 
 
 No Spamming  
 
 Threads that are not related to the forum's description, posts that are not related to the discussion, or posts made with the intention of bringing the user's post count up will be considered to be spam. An edit function is provided by the forum software and should be used to minimize multiple sequential posts. 
 
 Respect Forum Moderators, Administrators and Members  
 
 If you have any problems with any of the staff, please contact one of the Administrator(s). Attacking any forum staff will be considered as violating the "No abuse, insults or personal attacks" rule. 
 
 Disclaimer by Efecte  
 
 All content is provided in this online forum "as is" without Efecte verifying the correctness or appropriateness. Efecte takes no responsibility for the content provided from the community. Posts including images will always need approval by a moderator before they are published. 
 
 User Activity  
 
 In the spirit of an active community, and since we aren't actively tracking who is working where, Efecte reserves the right to remove inactive user accounts after 3 months or when we become aware that a user is not part of the Efecte Community anymore (just considering the very unlikely situation you would use another service management tool ever after having used Efecte...) 
 
 Removing User Account  
 
 If you would like to have your account and information removed please send a message to our Service Desk with the subject title: "Efecte Community Delete User Account".

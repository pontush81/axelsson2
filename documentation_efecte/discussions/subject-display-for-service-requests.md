Hello everyone,
We want to make self service a little more attractive for our users, but there's one detail that scares a lot of people and they can't do anything about it. When a request is created manually in the ESM, it is always displayed as a "general request" in the ESS. You only see the description when you expand it. Is there any way to get the subject to show up there too, like with incidents? My boss really wants a proper view.

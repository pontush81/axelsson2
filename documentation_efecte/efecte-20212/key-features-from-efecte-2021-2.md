Key Features from Efecte 2021.2 
Identity and Access Management Capabilities 
 Group lifecycle management for AD & AAD: Administrators can now verify, create, update, and delete groups to their identity repositories using event-based provisioning through ESM’s visual workflow automation.  
 Please note that these improvements are with the Efecte Provisioning Engine (EPE) component.  
 Enhanced event-based provisioning: Administrators can now choose if information relating to the organization unit (OU-path) is defined as a provisioning task or read from a datacard. This enhancement will allow organizations to use one provisioning task with selected information from the related dotard instead of multiple event-based provisioning tasks.  
 Please note that these improvements are with the Efecte Provisioning Engine (EPE) component.  
Self-Service Capabilities 
 Hide user inputs: Self-service administrators are now able to hide sensitive information provided using the datatype TextField. Administrators can flexibly define the fields which should have this feature. When enabled, user-provided information will be replaced with *****.

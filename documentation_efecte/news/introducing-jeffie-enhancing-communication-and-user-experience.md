We are excited to introduce Jeffie, our new digital assistant, designed to revolutionize how we communicate with our customers and end users within the Efecte Service Management (ESM) tool. As part of our continuous effort to improve user experience and engagement, Jeffie brings a new level of interactivity and efficiency to our platform.
Over the years, we have explored various methods to ensure that our users are well-informed and aware of all the latest features and improvements. Traditional communication channels like newsletters and community posts, while useful, often fall short in reaching every end user and even administrator effectively. The lack of awareness sometimes results in a perception that the solution would not evolve fast enough. This causes unnecessary pressure on administrators from the users.   
To address this challenge, we're introducing Jeffie. Jeffie is designed to provide important announcements related to the Efecte ecosystem. For example, Jeffie will inform users about new features that can improve their efficiency and user experience.
Jeffie will be shown as a small icon in the bottom right-hand corner of ESM: 

If needed, users can move it to other locations on the screen. New announcements will pop up for users on predefined pages in the product. Users can also view the announcements in a list afterward.
Announcements will be published infrequently - typically around one or two notifications a month, with a few additional announcements after each release to highlight new features and improvements. Rest assured, we will not overwhelm you with constant notifications.
Moreover, Jeffie plays a crucial role in gathering feedback from end users. This feedback is essential for understanding user needs and continuously developing the user experience. By using Jeffie to collect feedback, we can ensure that our services are aligned with user expectations and make necessary improvements based on their input.
We'll start rolling out Jeffie to a limited number of environments in Finland starting in July. We are confident that Jeffie will significantly enhance how we communicate with the community of Efecte users and admins, providing a more seamless and engaging experience. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve and improve Jeffie’s capabilities!
Edit 10.09.2024: With the upcoming 2024.2 release, we are excited to expand Jeffie’s presence across all cloud environments. This update introduces multi-language support and enhances the way we communicate directly within the ESM tool. Jeffie will be enabled in December after all environments have been upgraded to the 2024.2 version.

  ContentsIncluded functionalitiesFunctionalities planned for future versions The Efecte Service Management Tool 2023.2.0 introduced an early access beta version of the new user interface (UI) 🤩 It includes a new beta version of the list view and datacard view.  
 
 Instructions for enabling the early access beta UI can be found in the 2023.2.0 release notes and the admin manual.  
 In the comments of this community post, you can give us feedback regarding the list view. We highly appreciate your input since it helps us to provide the best possible user experience for the end users in the future!  
 Please see more details below on the scope - it’s easier to give feedback once the scope is known! Please also see the ESM 2023.2.0 release notes for more details.

The new UI is released early in terms of maturity, as an early access version, to allow iterative development based on user feedback.

 The following table shows examples of features available in the 2023.2.0 version. The next table includes examples of functionalities that are not in the scope of 2023.2.0 but which are to be implemented in future releases.

 Efecte is thrilled to announce the Pilot Phase of our new Configuration Transport Tool (CTT) for the Efecte Service Management tool (ESM). As a valued Efecte customer, you now have the exclusive opportunity to try out our pilot and be part of this development period. By trying out CTT and providing valuable feedback, you can actively contribute to shaping the future of ESM configuration management.   
 Key Features of CTT:  
 
 Visualize Configuration Changes: CTT provides a comprehensive view of configuration modifications. It highlights differences in template configurations, including added classes and attributes, changes in attribute configuration, folder structure variations, and role alterations. This visual representation enhances transparency, making it easier for administrators to identify and understand the changes made to their ESM environment. 
 Efficient Environment Comparison: CTT enables effortless comparisons between different environments. Whether you want to evaluate configuration variations between test and production settings or track changes within the same environment over time, CTT has covered you. By gaining insights into configuration evolution, you can make informed decisions and ensure the integrity of your ESM setup. 
 Seamless Configuration Transport: CTT simplifies the deployment process by allowing administrators to select specific changes and generate a configuration file for easy import into the ESM application. This feature automates configuration updates, eliminating the need for manual intervention and reducing the risk of errors. By streamlining the transport of configurations, you can save time and maintain consistency across your different ESM environments.

We’re exploring how conversational AI can move beyond just answering questions — and start resolving real user problems directly through chat.
Imagine your employees being able to say things like:

 🔒 “I lost my laptop — can you lock it?”


 🔄 “My device is missing apps.”


 📍 “Can you find my phone?”


 🧠 “I need access to the HR portal.”


 💼 “Order me a new headset.”

…and having those requests handled end-to-end, without filling out forms or waiting in ticket queues.
We’re currently evaluating a wide range of problems that could be solved through natural conversation. From device actions (via Intune) to approvals, onboarding, and guidance, the possibilities are growing fast.
👉 Which problems would you like to solve through a conversational experience?
Take our short survey to help us prioritize:

Your feedback will directly influence what we build next.
 
Thanks for shaping the future with us!

 Dear Efecte customer,  
 We are happy to inform you that the UI renewal of the Efecte Service Management Tool (ESM) is in progress. A new, refreshed, and improved agent user interface for selected application parts is soon waiting around the corner. As you might have noticed from the roadmap plan of ESM, the renewal of the agent user interface will be started by addressing the header bar and navigation panel. As a kind reminder, please check the following posts in the Efecte Community:

 In addition to the header bar and navigation panel, the appearance of related dialogs will be renewed, including the customization options. Since selected agent user interface parts will be refreshed and improved, we recommend preparing for the change in good time before the version upgrade. Communication about the upcoming changes to end-users might be worth a consideration. Areas such as custom-made user manuals and RPA solutions might be affected by the change. Also, custom logos might be affected.  
 We will provide more information on the upcoming changes in May, including screenshots of the new user interface parts.    
 According to the planned schedule, the Q2 release (ESM 2022.2 version) will be installed in cloud and private development and test environments by the end of May and then in production environments in June, before the midsummer holidays. The exact scheduling of development, test, and production upgrades will be communicated according to the standard procedure before the upgrades occur. Even though we're thrilled by the upcoming usability improvements and the refreshed user interface, we acknowledge that changes in the user interface might require actions by system administrators. However, the UI improvements do not affect customer-specific configurations.   
 In case you see challenges with the upcoming release, do not hesitate to contact us right away via Efecte Service Desk (servicedesk@efecte.com). 
 We are excited by all the improvements that will be made to the header bar, navigation panel, and related dialogs. We also look forward to continuing to renew the other parts of the application for the upcoming releases!  
 Kind regards, The Efecte team

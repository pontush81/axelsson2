ContentsDescription of functionalitySelection of periods TabsChatsQuestions & Answers Average number of questions & Answers Average chat length Disconnection mode Agent availability Agent Load Attention A new reporting module for Efecte Chat is now available, allowing service managers to view chat statistics and plan support capacity accurately.   
 The module requires a valid chat license in ESM (Efecte Service Management) and write permissions to Efecte Chat Module giving an option to show reporting for selected users only.   
 Users can select the date range for visualized data, with the option to choose from predefined values or freely from calendar views.   
 There are two tabs for separate statistics: Chat Usage and Agent Statistics showing metrics such as: connection attempts, answered chats, unanswered chats, number of answers/questions, average chat length, agent load, agent availability.   
   
 Features:   
 IEI-3664, IEI-3705 Chat Reports Icon in the header.   
 This icon [1] in the header is visible to users who have a valid Efecte Chat license and either admin or write permissions to the Efecte Chat module. By clicking on the icon, users can easily access Efecte Chat Reports and view statistics related to chat usage and agent performance.  
    
  
 IEI-4041 Reports groups into two separate tabs: Chat Usage, Agents.   
 The reporting module in Efecte Chat groups statistics into two separate tabs: Chat Usage and Agents. This allows us to access and analyze the relevant data and to make informed decisions about the support capacity planning.   
  
 IEI-3667 Fetch Data from InteliWISE platform.   
 With this feature, data is automatically fetched from the InteliWISE platform every time a user opens Efecte Chat Reports. This ensures that users have access to the most up-to-date information on chat usage and agent performance.

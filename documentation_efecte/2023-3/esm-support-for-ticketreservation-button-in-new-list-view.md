 Problem statement  
 In the early access beta UI of ESM 2023.2, the list view currently offers a restricted range of supported handlers and functionalities. Unfortunately, one functionality that's currently missing is the ability to reserve tickets for support personnel.  
  Short description  
 We are introducing an enhancement to address this issue. The next release is planned to add support for the TicketReservation button within the new list view in the early access beta UI.  
  Use case details  
 The TicketReservation button, which relies on the TicketReservation and CategoryDropdownReference handlers, will now be integrated into the new list view of the early access beta UI. This improvement will facilitate smoother ticket reservation processes and enhance the overall user experience.

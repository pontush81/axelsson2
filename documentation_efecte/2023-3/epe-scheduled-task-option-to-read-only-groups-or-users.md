  ContentsUser story:Background information:What?How?Why?To whom?User story: 
 As an admin of Efecte's Provisioning Engine tool (EPE), I want to easily configure new EPE tasks just right for our use case.  
 As an admin I want to EPE support importing groups or users not always both of them. At the moment, it is not possible to choose to import only users or groups.    
Background information: 
What? 
 
 This is part of the EPE usage improvements story 
 
How? 
 
   EPE Administrator can choose Mappings type for scheduled-based task from these options:  
   
     Identity & Access rights - users and groups mappings are available   
     Single (Identity only) - only Users mappings are available   
     Single (Access Rights only) - only Groups' mappings are available   
     Generic (One template) - template mappings are available   
     Default is Identity & Access rights   
    
 
Why? 
 
 This helps configuring EPE tasks, more flexibility 
 
To whom? 
 
 EPE Administrators

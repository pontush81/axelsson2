 Problem statement  
 The datacard view within the early access beta UI of ESM 2023.2 currently offers a constrained range of supported handlers and functionalities. Notably, one function that is absent is the capability to reserve tickets for support personnel.  
  Short description  
 We are introducing an enhancement to rectify this limitation. In ESM 2023.3, we are planning to provide support for the TicketReservation button within the newly introduced datacard view in the early access beta UI.  
  Use case details  
 The TicketReservation button, which relies on the TicketReservation and CategoryDropdownReference handlers, will now be seamlessly integrated into the datacard view of the early access beta UI. This enhancement aims to streamline the ticket reservation process and elevate the overall user experience.

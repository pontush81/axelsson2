 Problem statement  
 In the early access beta UI of ESM 2023.2, the datacard view is currently equipped with only a restricted set of supported handlers and functionalities. Notably, the conditional attributes ("Enable if") functionality, which enables attributes based on conditions, is absent from the available features.  
  Short description  
 We are introducing an enhancement to address this issue. We are planning to introduce support for the conditional attributes functionality within the newly introduced datacard view in the early access beta UI.  
  Use case details  
 The functionality of conditional attributes in the new datacard view will closely align with that of the current UI, ensuring a seamless and familiar experience for users.

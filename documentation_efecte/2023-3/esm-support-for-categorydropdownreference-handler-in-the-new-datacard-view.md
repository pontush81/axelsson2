 Problem statement  
 In the early access beta UI of ESM 2023.2, the datacard view presents a constrained selection of supported handlers and functionalities. Notably, one functionality that is currently missing is the CategoryDropdownReference handler, which is used for filtering reference values.  
  Short description  
 We are introducing an enhancement to address this issue. We are planning to introduce support for the CategoryDropdownReference handler within the newly implemented datacard view in the early access beta UI.  
  Use case details  
 The functionality of the CategoryDropdownReference handler in the new datacard view will mirror that of the current UI. This addition aims to maintain a consistent and familiar experience while enabling users to filter reference values effectively.

 Problem statement  
 ESS2 has supported field types such as string, single-value static string, and text from its launch. However, so that admins can configure much more extensive forms for collecting data, new field types such as dates and multi-value static strings are needed.  
  Short description  
 ESS2 will introduce four new types of fields for admins to configure in the ESS2 Forms: date, date and time, multi-value static string and checkbox.  
  Use case details  
 
 As an administrator, I want to allow my users to specify a date and/or time as a response to a question, so that my agents can use the information appropriately. 
 As an administrator, I want my users to be able to select one or more items from a specified set which is based on template static selection values. 
 As an administrator, I want to provide a checkbox selection for the end-user, so they can select one or more items from specified values. Checkbox values are based on template static selection values.

 When expanding an existing request, the individual fields are not using the available UI space in an optimal manner. This causes issues with readability, when some fields have very long content.  
  
 ACs:  
 
 Fields with long content shall use an area that equals to the width of two columns 
 The text shall not overflow from the allocated area 
 In case a narrow resolution is used, the allocated space shall not exceed the total space available

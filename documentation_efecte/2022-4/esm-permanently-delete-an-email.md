   When we have the new UI for the emails, we plan to have a new feature that would allow the user to permanently delete individual email with attachments from the discussion.  
 UI should have a way to select the email to be deleted and a functionality to trigger the deletion with confirmation dialogue. More details later on.  Comments welcome!

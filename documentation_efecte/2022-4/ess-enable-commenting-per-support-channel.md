 As an ESS admin, I want to enable/disable comments per support channel, in order to make more flexible configurations.  
  
 It will be possible to enable/disable comments in support channel level, separately for incidents and service requests.  
  
 Note: Availability of commenting depends on the current setting for the used support channel. Changing the support channel retroactively cannot affect which support channel was used when the request was created.   
  
 Prerequisite:   
 Global setting for comments need to be enabled in the Settings tag, for incidents and service requests respectively.

 This section displays the roadmap of Efecte's platform.  
 The new capabilities are displayed with various statuses: Roadmapped, Next Up, In Progress, and Released assigned to the targeted quarterly release.  
 "Roadmapped" refers to features that have been planned to be implemented in the coming 6 months. Input from the community is highly appreciated to improve the fit of the new capability for as many customers as possible.  
 "NextUp" means that the feature is targeted to be developed in the coming weeks. It is very likely that the functionality will be developed. At this stage, we have done the feasibility study, a reasonable work estimate (we do use Fibonacci numbers), and a rough implementation design. At this stage, we can still take feedback into account assuming it doesn't change the effort size significantly.  
 "In Progress" stands for features that are being currently developed in our R&D. Development might mean that we are building a rapid prototype or we are actively developing the actual new code. At this stage, feedback will rather contribute to enhancements at a later point of time, but we still would love to hear it.  
 "Done" stands for the feature implementation being ready and unit tested, and pending Q&A including integration and performance testing.  
 "Released" means that the new feature has been released in a new version of Efecte's platform. The release might be piloted by selected customers, it might be deployed in customer's test environments or its embedded in the current release with general availability.  
 You can filter the upcoming features by both the status as well by the module of Efecte's platform for easier readability of the roadmap.  
 Please kindly note: This roadmap overview does not represent any commercial commitment of Efecte to develop the functionality. If a commercial commitment is required for your planning purposes then please get in touch with your account representative.  
 It may be that some developments are abandoned at any stage of the development process due to other conflicting priorities, a change in market demand, or unforeseen architectural issues. We try our best to avoid such events by not placing new features here in the Roadmapped status of who we don't have a reasonable confidence that they will be implemented. But it does happen, even to us, and we will certainly explain in the comments why we decided to abandon a new feature development.

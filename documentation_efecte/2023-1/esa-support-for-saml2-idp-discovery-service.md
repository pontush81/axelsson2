User story: 
  As an administrator, I would like to support federated authentication without the need to add each IDP as an authentication method to ESA.  
 This will help me to better handle for example HAKA and Virtu federation so that I can include a single HAKA authentication button and the user can then select a home organization from the discovery service.  
 In addition, a support for automated metadata refresh from a url would be required, so that all entities defined by the federation would be up-to-date. AC's:  
 
 ESA supports SAML Discovery Service  
 ESA can automatically update metadata defined by a URL

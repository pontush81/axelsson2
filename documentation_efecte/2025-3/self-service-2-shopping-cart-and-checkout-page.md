Problem statement
End users cannot add items to a shopping cart when they want to collect multiple items at once. They also cannot see a summary of the items they would like to order before confirming the order.
 
Short description
The self-service portal shall support adding catalog items to a shopping cart and displaying the cart summary on the checkout page.
 
Use case details
When the shopping cart is enabled, “Add to Cart” replaces instant ordering and users can add multiple items to the cart. A dedicated checkout page summarizes each entry—item name, delivery time, and price — and shows the order total. Upon submission, the system creates a separate datacard for each cart entry.

 Users can add up to 20 items to the cart and see a live badge count in the header
 The cart retains its contents between visits, even when switching between browsers or devices
 Checkout page summarizes each entry with the item name, delivery time, and price
 Checkout page shows an order total
 System creates separate data card per cart entry.

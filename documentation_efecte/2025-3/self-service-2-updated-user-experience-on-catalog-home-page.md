Problem statement
The catalog home page would be more user-friendly if items from certain category (e.g., favorited items) is already promoted there. This way, users wouldn’t need to search through all categories to find them.
 
Short description
The catalog home page should improve the user experience by making promoted items easily discoverable. This includes displaying the promoted category and its items, if the administrator chooses to expose them to end users.
 
Use case details
The catalog home page now supports visual category tiles by allowing admins to configure a category image. Admins can also highlight a selected category with a featured items carousel at the top of the catalog home page to promote priority offerings.

 In Catalog & Orders / Catalog settings, the admin can select a category from a list of cateogories
 The catalog home page shall support to display a name and an image on each category 
  
   Admin shall be able to configure and upload an image for the category

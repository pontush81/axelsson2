    Service Template ITIL4.xml
  
  
   The attached XML.file includes an example Service template in accordance to ITIL 4. If the template is imported, then it will be added to the CMDB module of the Service Management Tool.  
 If you want to update your existing Service template, depending on the current configuration, you can consider taking the following steps:  
 - add Service continuity as a class - add RTO and RPO attributes - rename Running Cost class to Value class - add Costs removed attribute - add Revenues generated attribute - add Total value attribute and calculate its value from revenues minus costs - add Risks attribute as reference to easiest - add Related SaaS component with reference to the corresponding template  
 If you do upload the entire template, then please do remember to create folders to store data cards for this template. You also need to specify template and folder permissions. Also don't forget to set the references in this template because references are not imported. Finally, remember to remove and add the shared class of General Information according to your configuration.
